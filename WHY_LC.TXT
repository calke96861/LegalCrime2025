What makes Legal Crime different from other games?


*** ORIGINAL THEME

Being an organized crime leader is thrilling and unique. The player neither saves the world nor is a hero - he may wake up the little mafioso within him. Only in the virtual world of Legal Crime, of course.


*** EXCITING REAL-TIME STRATEGY

Neither real life or Legal Crime are turn-based. Everything happens in real time and the player is always in a slight hurry. But the game is not an action game - success is determined by the ingenuity of one's actions, not by the speed of his reflexes.


*** TRULY GLOBAL GAMING SYSTEM

The funniest part is to play against other people over the net. A game started on one server is immediately visible on all the others. The protocol is very lag-tolerant, and is playable even with 2000 ms lag. Most games cannot come even close to this.

We have servers in the US, Germany, UK, Belgium, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Italy, Israel, China, Australia...


*** NEW GAMING CULTURE

The users have put up their own organized Legal Crime families, which fight against each other for power. Close bonds have developed within these virtual families, with a feeling of solidarity with people they have usually never seen in real life. A whole new culture has matured with Legal Crime. There are Legal Crime tournaments, best player awards etc.

Players play ranked games on Case's Legal Crime ladder. The families stick together even in games with no teams or alliances. This game really unites the family of virtual organized crime.


*** CONTINOUS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT WITH USERS

Legal Crime was developed in co-operation with about 5000 beta testers throughout the world. The game would not be what it is today without their ideas and suggestions. We are still very eager to hear the users' comments, because we keep developing the game further.


*** COMPLETE INTERNET PRODUCT

The game is distributed, developed, supported and sold through the net. Everything takes place in the net. A product can not get more on the net than Legal Crime is.


*** SOPHISTICATED LICENSE NUMBER CONTROL

Whenever a player enters the gaming network, his license number is verified on our server. Should a user violate the agreement by allowing other people use the same number, the license code can be revoked within minutes.
