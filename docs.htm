  to <A HREF="legalcrime.html">Legal Crime</A>, a real-time strategy game
  by <A HREF="byte_enchanters.html">Byte Enchanters, Ltd!</A> In the game
  you are the leader of an organized crime gang. The object of the game is
  to gain political and economic control over the city. This will require
  force, armed attacks and a clever defense, an astute mind and trickiness.
  You must build an empire of organized crime, crush other families via cleverly
  timed attacks and legal bills. You must bribe the police and the politicians,
  sell booze and extort from shopkeepers.</P>
  <P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Please do not try anything you see in the game in real
  life.</FONT></B></P>
  <P>This game functions only in the net - it is intended only for human
  opponents. It is not designed for single player mode. No matter how clever
  the computer might get, it is still much more fun to beat human opponents.</P>
  <P>We have made every attempt to make the game as challenging and thrilling
  as possible but still entertaining. We would be filled with gratitude for
  <A HREF="tuotepalaute.html">your comments</A> about the game, these pages
  or anything else that we might be able to help you with. The game is also
  <A HREF="http://www.kali.net/">Kali</A> -compatible (you may start the
  games from Kali), but Kali is not required for the game to work.</P>
  <P>Have fun!</P>

  <LI>Open the GameClient folder and run Setup.exe by double clicking it.
  <LI>You are presented with the License agreement and the Read me file.
  Choose the location you want to install the game in and the installer will
  do the rest for you. The complete installation should take no longer than
  one or two minutes. If you're upgrading, let the installer copy the new
  files over the old ones.
  <LI>If you do not have DirectX installed, you need to <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/DIRECTX/RESOURCES/downloads/Dx3busa.exe">download

  DirectX.
  <LI>When you first start the game, you are asked for a license number.
  Enter each 1-6 digit number in a separate box and press OK. If the OK button
  does not appear, you have most likely mistyped the license number. Be sure
  to enter one 1-6 digit number in each box. There should be a number in
  each of the seven boxes. You do not need to re-enter the license number
  later when you update the software. Do not lose your number, however, because
  you might need it in case of technical problems.

  location of the initiator of the game &shy; if he/she is far away from
  you, you might experience lag which makes the game less enjoyable.</P>
  <P>If there are no games listed, there are no games starting up. There
  may be other players just waiting for someone to start a game or there
  might be a game in progress - be brave and start a game of your own.</P>
  <P>You can start a new game if you do not wish to join any of the existing
  games by pressing the <B>Enter Gaming Network</B>.</P>
  <P>In addition to the initiator and his/her location, you may wish to consider
  the skill of the player. If he is almost a real organized crime leader

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>At the beginning of the game you have your headquarters (<B>HQ</B>)
  and two gangsters - one armed with a baseball bat and one with a gun. Try
  moving around a little: click on either of the gangsters, then click the
  <B>Go</B> button from the bottom of the screen and then click on your destination
  from either the little map or the main screen. If your gangster encounters
  an enemy, he automatically starts to fight. You can also use a shortcut
  to move: click on your gangster with the left mouse button, then click
  somewhere on the map with the right button. This is the same as giving
  the <B>Go</B> command.</P>
  <P><IMG SRC="Pics/documentation/open.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="1" ALT="Open-sign"><IMG SRC=
  "Pics/documentation/percent.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="1" ALT="Percent sign">You
  might notice around you some buildings that have an &quot;open&quot; sign
  on them. They are various shops and other businesses owned by regular citizens.
  Also, they are the first source of your income. Click on a gangster and
  then give the <B>Extort</B> command and then select an open business (note:
  you can also do this by giving a regular <B>Go</B> command with its destination
  an open business). The shopkeeper might not be willing to pay for your
  &quot;protection&quot; at first, but your gangster automatically starts
  to &quot;negotiate&quot; with him. The bigger the business and the weaker
  the gangster, the harder it is to make the shopkeeper pay you. He might
  call the cops and then you should run away or the cops will arrest your
  gangster and he is gone forever. If you are successful, a rotating percent
  (%) sign will appear on top of the building - this represents that a certain
  percentage of the income of the business given to you for your &quot;protection&quot;.</P>
  <P><IMG SRC="Pics/documentation/courier.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="1" ALT="Collector">After
  this a man with a briefcase starts to walk between the business and your
  headquarters. He is a collector. His job is to carry the money from the
  business to you. His function is fully automatic - you cannot control him
  in any way. By clicking on him you can see the amount of money he is carrying
  at the moment. The collectors are very weak and get killed easily. If this
  happens, the killer gets the money and it is directly transferred to his
  headquarters. So if you have a profitable business far away from your headquarters,
  the collector might need some protection or he might get robbed by your
  rivals.</P>
  <P>When you click on a business you're extorting, you can see the amount
  of money the shopkeeper pays you and the amount of money that sits there,
  uncollected (this value is reset to zero when your collector visits the
  place).</P>
  <P>There are several other buttons for upgrading your extorted business
  to a real illegal business. You may upgrade to different branches of illegal
  business - <I>bootlegging </I>is the manufacture and sales of liquor, <I>entertainment</I>
  is a form of prostitution, <I>gambling</I> is just what it sounds like
  and <I>troubleshooting</I> is dealing with troublesome people by shooting
  them. Also, you may find a supporting building, which is discussed in detail
  later.</P>
  <P>After choosing the branch you want to invest in, you are presented with
  1-5 possible upgrades to your business. Usually you should upgrade to the
  most expensive business you can afford. The bigger the business and the
  better its location, and the more money it will produce.</P>
  <P>If the building gets damaged in a fight, its profit is not optimal and
  needs to be repaired in order to be fully profitable. Use the repair button
  for this.</P>
  <P>Note that when you upgrade the business to any other branch than <I>Support</I>,
  you are actually founding an illegal business. This usually costs a few
  hundred thousand dollars and takes some time, but is very profitable. Keep
  in mind that the police do not like illegal businesses. You need to bribe
  them to keep them away. Later it might be possible to further upgrade the
  business to make it more profitable, but this does not apply to all businesses.</P>
  <P>Now you might want to have more gangsters, but keep an eye on your income.
  Gangsters' salaries are pretty steep and might cause you to go bankrupt.
  There are several kinds of gangsters in Legal Crime. You'll need bribery
  in various places to be able to recruit the more advanced gangsters.</P>
  <P>Should you run out of funds and not be able to pay your gangsters' salaries,
  they will resign and become neutral. In this game neutrality means everybody's
  enemy &shy; the resigned gangsters will attack anybody in the city. The
  gangster who resigns is determined by chance. So if your own gangsters
  are in front of your HQ, some of them might resign which could cause the
  destruction of your crime empire.</P>
  <P>You recruit new gangsters with the buttons in the lower right-hand corner.
  At the beginning of the game there is just one button active; later there
  will be more when you've bribed the army.</P>

  screen and send it by pressing either the <B>Enter</B> or <B>Return</B>.
  Or press <B>Esc</B> to cancel the message.</P>
  <P>You see other players' messages in the top left corner, among other
  game messages. By pressing the square beside the message you can see the
  headquarters of the player who sent you the message, if you know where
  it is (you have seen it earlier in the game). You can control who you send
  your messages to via the <B>Menu</B> command in the upper left-hand corner.</P>
  <H3><A NAME="groupinggansters"></A>Grouping gangsters</H3>
  <P>When you've activated a group of gangsters you may wish to make them
  a group to make it easier to handle these guys later. Press <B>Ctrl</B>
  and a number from <B>0-9</B>. The number represents the number of the group
  - you can have 10 different groups.</P>
  <P>To give a command to the whole group, first select it by pressing a
  number from <B>0</B> to <B>9</B> and then give the command in the usual
  fashion. You still may command the gangsters individually if you wish.</P>
  <H3><A NAME="fighting"></A>Fighting</H3>
  <P>At any given moment, a gangster can only be executing one command. If
  you give him another command, the first one will be canceled and replaced
  by the second one.</P>

  <P>You have to keep a few things in mind to keep you from running out of
  funds.</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><B>Upgrading</B> is expensive - make sure you have enough funds for
    salaries even while upgrading.</P>
    <P><B>Collector'</B> money is usable to you only after it reaches your
    headquarters. Make sure they make it there alive and keep in mind that
    even if you have very profitable businesses, you cannot use that money
    while the collector is carrying it.</P>
    <P><B>Extorting</B> is free - do it a lot. But do keep in mind that if
    you hire gangsters to make businesses pay you, you have to pay these gangsters'
    salaries, too.</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>There are 4 branches of illegal business in Legal Crime: <B>Bootlegging</B>
  (manufacture and sale of alcohol), <B>Entertainment</B> (bordellos etc.),
  <B>Gambling</B> and <B>Troubleshooting </B>(hit men etc.). All these can
  be legalized except Troubleshooting. When you bribe the police, you may
  try to legalize alcohol, which makes Bootlegging businesses much less profitable.</P>
  <P>The larger a market share of a business you have, the more money you
  will make. If you have a monopoly in that branch, you'll make double of
  what you'd ordinarily make. So it is profitable to specialize in one branch
  of a business, but keep in mind that if that branch is legalized, your
  income will drop dramatically.</P>

  <P>When you encounter enemies, you'll recognize them, by the color of their
  hats (red). Enemies' businesses and headquarters have similar symbols on
  them as yours, but enemy buildings always have red symbols.</P>
  <P>Usually your gangsters automatically start to fight when they encounter
  an enemy gangster. They do not consider their chances of winning - they
  just fight until they win or die. If this should happen, you of course
  no longer have to pay your gangster his salary.</P>
  <H3><A NAME="object"></A>The objective of the game</H3>
  <P>What would you expect? :-) The object of the game is to make the most
  money, acquire the strongest army of gangsters, gain the most power and
  to crush your enemies. The winner of the game is the one who has survived
  the longest time, i.e. is the last one to survive.</P>

  car represents its physical condition. It shortens and first turns yellow
  and then red when the car is hit in a fight; after that the car is destroyed
  (or a gangster is dead). The gangsters can not be healed nor the cars repaired.</P>
  <P>In the lower part of this window there is a help text that tells you
  something about the unit/command that you are about to give. For example,
  here you have moved the cursor over the bar that you bribe the army with
  (your cursor is not visible in this picture because the bribing happens
  in <A HREF="#palkit">another window</A>.)</P>
  <P><A NAME="palkit"></A><IMG SRC="Pics/documentation/palkit.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT"
  BORDER="1" ALT="Funds & spending window" WIDTH="208" HEIGHT="215" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
  "0">You control your spending with the third window. First you see your
  <B>funds</B>, that is, the money you have in your pocket. In this example,
  the gang has $781 380. Next you see your income, the total income of all
  businesses minus your expenses, such as the gangsters' salaries. If you
  run out of cash, you automatically borrow money (with outrageous interest
  rate). If you can not pay your gangsters' salaries, they resign and start
  to fight against everybody, including yourself. If you cannot even pay
  the interest on your debts, you lose.</P>
  <P>Below the income figure there are 5 bars that you use to control your
  spending. To gain various benefits, you need to bribe various people. The
  first bar (with the dollar ($) sign) is the money you put into <B>savings</B>,
  that is - this money goes directly into your funds to be used when upgrading
  a business or recruiting a gangster. Next (with the picture of a tank)
  is the army. You bribe <B><A HREF="http://www.army.mil/">the army</A></B>
  to get better weapons. The <B><A HREF="http://www.fbi.gov/">FBI</A></B>
  is bribed to get information about other gangsters. <B>The <A HREF="http://www.senate.gov/">public
  officials and city council</A></B> (picture of the city hall) can aid you
  in passing laws in your favor, such as voting for abolishing the probationary
  liquor law or gaining a special permit to establish a casino. The final
  bribing bar (with the picture of a star) is used to bribe the <B><A HREF=
  "http://www.spinet.gov.sg/pollink/usa1.html">police</A></B>. You need this
  to buy the police - if bribed enough, you can even ask the police to raid
  your enemies' businesses.</P>
  <P><IMG SRC="Pics/documentation/napit.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="Button bar">Note
  that when the cursor is on the second bar, you see the percentage of your
  income used to bribe the army in the <A HREF="#keski">middle window</A>.
  Note also that the bribing works only when you have income. In this particular
  example it would make no difference to adjust the bribing bars because
  the income is negative.100% of $0 is still $0. However, as soon as the
  player gets his cash flow positive, money starts to flow to all the accounts
  in the spending window. You can not bribe using money in <B>funds</B>;
  bribing is only possible by directing some of your income to your &quot;friends
  in public offices&quot;.</P>
  <P><A NAME="napit"></A>On the far right there is a bar with several buttons
  on it. You use these to recruit new gangsters to your group. When you click
  on a button, a vertical bar representing the recruiting process appears.
  Each gangster costs a different amount of money to recruit and their salaries
  and recruiting times vary. You can see the direct expense in the bottom
  of the middle window when you hold the cursor over a button (without pressing
  the mouse button).</P>
  <P>Note that all these gangsters are not immediately available to you at
  the beginning of the game. Recall that you need to bribe the army to get
  better weapons and gangsters. So if you keep bribing them, sooner or later
  a better gangster should be available to you.</P>
  <P>On the upper left-hand corner of the screen there is a menu and an area
  for game messages. By clicking on the menu you can choose your allies and
  enemies (of course your allies do not have to ally with you), choose who
  you send your messages to and quit the game.</P>
  <P><IMG SRC="Pics/documentation/chat.GIF" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="1" ALT="Messages">You
  get all kinds of information via the messages, such as when you start extorting
  from a business or when you lose one, when another player sends you a message
  or when a shopkeeper calls the cops. You send messages to other players
  by pressing the <B>Enter</B> key, typing your message and pressing <B>Return</B>.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Bribing plays a major role in Legal Crime. To be successful in the underworld,
  you need to give money to the right people to gain certain privileges.</P>
  <P>You adjust your income to the various instances. You can not take bribe
  money from your (bank) funds, only from your income. If your income is
  0 or less, you have to make it positive to be able to bribe.</P>
  <P>When something has become available to you after bribing, a new button
  appears. For example, when you can recruit a new gangster, a button appears
  on the right side of the screen where the recruit buttons are located.
  Or, when it becomes possible to have the cops raid an enemy business, the
  raid-button appears on the screen when the enemy business is clicked.</P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>You need to bribe the police to be able to found profitable businesses
    in the shops you extort from. The more you bribe, the better businesses
    you can found. You may have the police raid an enemy business by clicking
    on the enemy building. (If you have bribed enough, a button will appear
    that will let you have the cops raid the place.) Also, you can tell the
    police to arrest enemy gangsters.</P>

  <H3><A HREF="http://www.army.mil/">Army</A></H3>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>This is your supply of weapons. By bribing the army you gain more efficient
    gangsters, such as pistol men, shotgun men and Thompson men - and even
    a Cadillac for drive-by-shootings.</P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><A HREF="http://www.fbi.gov/">The Federal Bureau of Investigation</A>
    sells you information - for a price. You may gain knowledge on the location
    of an enemy business, the enemy headquarters, their funds, income or gangsters,
    allies etc.</P>
    <P>By clicking on the enemy HQ, you see a button (if you have bribed enough)
    which allows you to have an FBI agent go and talk to the enemy leader -
    he cannot do anything for about 10 seconds. You may disguise your gangster
    to sneak into the enemy forces.</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H3><A HREF="http://www.senate.gov/">Politicians</A></H3>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Forget about democracy - it is the money that buys you power. You may
    have enemy businesses demolished (click on the business and then on the
    appearing buttons), have the electricity cut off for a while (this decreases
    the income on the block) or hire a thief, who can steal money from enemy
    businesses. You may also start evil rumors about the enemy.</P>
    <P>If you click on your own HQ, you may start to legalize a certain business
    branch, which decreases the income on that branch. This allows you to decrease
    the income of the enemy.</P>

  <H3>Stake out</H3>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>You may turn your businesses into stake outs, which are buildings from
    where your gangsters shoot the enemies. These &quot;businesses&quot; can
    be abolished as usual (by smashing them), or by sending the police to raid
    the business. You need not put your gangsters in these buildings, they
    automatically contain one gunman.</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H3>Training Center</H3>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>You train new gangsters in training centers. So, if you own one, you
    will recruit new gangsters much faster than without one. The more training
    centers you own, the faster the recruiting will be. To have new gangsters
    appear in the front of a training center instead of your HQ, first click
    on the Training Center and then the Primary Training Center button.</P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H3>Collection Center</H3>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>When your collectors bring the money in from your businesses, they are
    very vulnerable to enemy fire. Collection centers reduce the distance your
    collectors have to walk. If there is a Collection center closer to the
    collector than the HQ is, he will take his money to the Collection center,
    which will speed up the collection of money considerably.</P>
